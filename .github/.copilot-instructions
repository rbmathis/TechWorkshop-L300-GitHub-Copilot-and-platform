# Copilot Instructions

## Build Verification After Code Changes

After every code change, execute the following build command to ensure nothing has broken:

```bash
cd /workspaces/TechWorkshop-L300-GitHub-Copilot-and-platform/src && dotnet build
```

### Guidelines

1. **Mandatory Build Check**: Run `dotnet build` after completing any code modifications
2. **Verify Success**: Ensure the build completes successfully (exit code 0)
3. **Report Issues**: If the build fails, report the error details and do not proceed with further changes until the issue is resolved
4. **Apply Fixes**: If build failures occur, investigate and fix the issues before completing the task

### Applicable File Types

- C# files (\*.cs)
- CSHTML files (\*.cshtml)
- Configuration files (appsettings.json)
- Project files (\*.csproj)
- Any other files that could affect the build

### Build Failure Handling

When the build fails:

1. Stop making additional changes
2. Display the error message to the user
3. Investigate the root cause
4. Fix the issues
5. Re-run the build to confirm resolution
